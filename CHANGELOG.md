# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Replaced docs set with canonical, task-oriented names and rewritten content:
  - `docs/overview.md`
  - `docs/contract-model.md`
  - `docs/capabilities.md`
  - `docs/controller-compatibility.md`
  - `docs/type-ids.md`
  - `docs/protocol-versioning.md`
- Removed legacy planning/policy doc names from `docs/` and aligned README links/layout.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Shared capability contract header: `include/bread/bread_caps.h`.
- Canonical `GET_CAPS` contract support in device headers:
  - `dcmt_query_caps` / `dcmt_get_caps`
  - `rlht_query_caps` / `rlht_get_caps`
- Capability constants for DCMT and RLHT (levels + flags).
- Controller examples now expose `caps` commands and capability-aware command gating.

### Breaking

- Removed generation-scoped include paths from the public API:
  - `include/bread/gen1/*`
  - `include/bread/gen2/*`
  - `include/bread/gen3/*`

### Changed

- Public include surface is now generation-free and capability-oriented.
- `bread_ops.h` now includes canonical top-level headers:
  - `bread_caps.h`
  - `bread_version_helpers.h`
  - `dcmt_ops.h`
  - `rlht_ops.h`
- README and docs aligned to capability-first model.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Initial repository bootstrap.
- Header-only contract layout under `include/bread/`.
- Family include header `bread_ops.h`.
- Device contract headers:
  - `dcmt_ops.h`
  - `rlht_ops.h`
- Shared version parse and compatibility helpers.
- Governance docs for versioning, type IDs, and compatibility policy.
- Package metadata for PlatformIO/Arduino/CMake consumers.
